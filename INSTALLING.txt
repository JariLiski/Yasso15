INSTALLING YASSO15:

On Windows, you can download a premade executable.

To install on Mac OS X, see mac_install.txt.

If you want to edit the program on Windows, these instructions are for you.

1) Install either Anaconda or Enthought Canopy (Express).

In case you install Anaconda, you will need to install packages like traits,
traitsui, enable, pyface and chaco.
If you want to use wxPython as the UI, do not install a version newer than 
wxPython 2.8.12, as newer versions do not seem to work with traitsui.

2) Install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) to get the C and Fortran compilers.
See www.mingw.org

3) Compile the Fortran module y15_subroutine.f95.
Add the MinGW directory to your path, then run the f2py script as follows 
in the program folder:

f2py-script.py -c --fcompiler=gnu95 --compiler=mingw32 -m y15 y15_subroutine.f90 only: mod5c

If you are using Anaconda, before compiling you may need to add the file 
"distutils.cfg" in your Anaconda/Lib/distutils directory with the content:

    [build]
    compiler=mingw32

4) There should now be y15.pyd in the folder; you can now run the application:

python yasso.py


CREATING AN EXE FOR WINDOWS WITH ANACONDA AND wxPython:

The folder pyinstaller/ contains yasso15_conda.spec file for PyInstaller. 
Remember to include MinGW in the path as you run pyinstaller with it. The 
folder dist/bin/ will contain the result. Remember to copy "yasso.ini",
"yasso.ico", "demo_data.txt", "LGPL.txt", "LICENSE.txt" and "BINLICENSES.txt"
and the folder "param" into that directory.

NOTE: This .spec file does not work with PyInstaller 3. You will need an
earlier version of PyInstaller from the repository.
